# More Better Python

It's the time of year when people start compiling lists of things, so I thought I'd embrace that with a quick list of 10 things I've recently folded into my Python toolbox.

## 1. Paint it Black
## 2. Automatically Excecute Black and Flake8 Before Git Commits

Black (auto-formatting) and Flake8 (PEP8 linter) are great tools for writing clean code, but they only work if you use them. Using them manually: sure. Using them automatically: YES PLEASE!

This is a really cool way of doing automatic execution of Black and Flake8 before a git commit, which for my (and maybe your!) purposes is *exactly* where I want those tools to do their magic.

## 3. Jupyterhub/Jupyterlab (especially the terminal)

## 4. Using print() Smarter

## 5. TQDM

## 6. Python's stdlib has so. much. stuff.

## 7. VSCode + RemoteSSH + Python

VSCode, the IDE for IDE haters. RemoteSSH and Python supercharge it.

## 8. Better Exceptions

## 9. bpython

There's a better command-line REPL than iPython? YES!
